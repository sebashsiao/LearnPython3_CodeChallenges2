    "#### Difficult Python Code Challenges Involving Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "This article will help you review Python functions by providing some code challenges involving dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these challenges are difficult! Take some time to think about them before starting to code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might not get the solution correct on your first try — look at your output, try to find where you’re going wrong, and iterate on your solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if you get stuck, use our solution code! If you “Check Answer” twice with an incorrect solution, you should see an option to get our solution code. However, truly investigate that solution — experiment and play with the solution code until you have a good grasp of how it is working. Good luck!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "def some_function(some_input1, some_input2):\n",
    "  … do something with the inputs …\n",
    "  return output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a function that counts the number of values in a dictionary that are above a given number would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "def greater_than_ten(my_dictionary, number):\n",
    "  count = 0\n",
    "  for value in my_dictionary.values():\n",
    "    if value > number:\n",
    "      count += 1\n",
    "  return count\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And this would produce output like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> greater_than_ten({\"a\":1, \"b\":2, \"c\":3}, 0)\n",
    "3\n",
    ">>> greater_than_ten({\"a\":1, \"b\":2, \"c\":3}, 5)\n",
    "0\n",
    "```\n",
