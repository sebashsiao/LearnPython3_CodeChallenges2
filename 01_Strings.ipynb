    "\n",
    "#### Python Code Challenges involving Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "This article will help you review Python functions by providing some code challenges about strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these challenges are difficult! Take some time to think about them before starting to code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might not get the solution correct on your first try — look at your output, try to find where you’re going wrong, and iterate on your solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if you get stuck, use our solution code! If you “Check Answer” twice with an incorrect solution, you should see an option to get our solution code. However, truly investigate that solution — experiment and play with the solution code until you have a good grasp of how it is working. Good luck!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function Syntax\n",
    "As a refresher, function syntax looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "def some_function(some_input1, some_input2):\n",
    "  # … do something with the inputs …\n",
    "  return output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a function that finds the difference in length between two Strings would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def lengthDiff(str1, str2):\n",
    "  return len(str1) - len(str2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And this would produce output like:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> lengthDiff(\"Python\", \"rocks\")\n",
    "1\n",
    ">>> lengthDiff(\"Marco\", \"Polo\")\n",
    "1\n",
    ">>> lengthDiff(\"Kevin\", \"Durant\")\n",
    "-1\n",

    "## 1. Count Letters\n",
    "For the first code challenge, we are going to count the number of unique letters in a string. This means that when we are looking at the word, any new letters should be counted and any duplicates should not be counted. There are a few ways to solve this, but we can use the provided alphabet string to ensure that duplicates are not counted. Here is what we need to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the function to accept one parameter — the word whose letters we are counting\n",
    "2. Create a counter to keep track of unique letters\n",

    "We can use the `split` function with the space character provided in order to get an array of all of the words in the sentence. Next, we use the `in` keyword in order to loop through every element in our array of words. We check the length of each word and compare it against `x` to see if it is shorter. If any of the words in the array are shorter then we immediately return `False` and end the function. If we make through all of the words without returning `False`, we know we should return `True` since all of the word’s lengths were longer than `x`."
